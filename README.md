The research explores the application of an aircraft localization system in the context of infrastructure inspection, focusing on its application in vertical gardening. 

Through a detailed review of the problems and the working environment, the specifics of the International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS) competition are analyzed, 
for which a simulation world has been developed in the Gazebo environment. Using the ROS platform and tools such as Python, Pynput, OpenCV, and PyTorch, a software solution has been developed that enables object localization, 
drone management, and plant detection in the garden. The paper provides a detailed description of the localization systems, the drone management process, and the plant detection algorithms, mentioning the YOLO algorithm. 
Furthermore, the research explores future work possibilities, including voxelization of the detected world and trajectory planning implementation.
This paper provides a foundation for understanding and applying drone localization systems in specific infrastructure inspection scenarios such as vertical gardening.
